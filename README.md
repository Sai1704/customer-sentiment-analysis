# Customer-sentiment-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing large-scale customer reviews to extract meaningful insights for product improvement and decision-making. The dataset consists of over 23,000 customer reviews, which were processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The analysis includes text preprocessing, sentiment scoring, and thematic analysis to identify recurring pain points, positive drivers, and overall user perception. The goal of the project is not just sentiment classification, but translating qualitative feedback into actionable, data-driven insights that can support feature prioritization, customer experience improvement, and marketing strategy.

The project demonstrates practical application of Python-based NLP, exploratory data analysis, and insight communication, similar to how real-world product and marketing teams use user feedback at scale.

Tech Stack:
Python, NLP, Pandas, NumPy, Sentiment Analysis, Data Visualization
